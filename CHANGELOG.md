*Sometimes things come to you in a moment of inspiration, and in that moment, you can see the Matrix.*

- Abstracted more internal classes by nesting them inside the core client class.

## July 21st, 2019 - 0.4 build 248 - The Wizard of Oz
*Just like Dorothy, we've set off on the yellow brick road. This it the initial release which provides the core framework over which the rest will be built. Built on top of the amazing RestSharp and Newtonsoft libraries, this custom REST client aims to simplify interacting with the Freshdesk API in a strongly typed .NET world.*
- Initial release.
