# Release Notes

## July 23rd, 2019 - 0.4 build 257 - The Matrix Reloaded
*Agent Johnson said it best: "Then you are meant for one more thing: deletion."*
- Deleted the VirtualDictionary class and instead merged the code into CustomFields directly.
- Minor refactoring of ErrorField and ErrorFieldCode.

## July 22nd, 2019 - 0.4 build 251 - The Matrix
*Sometimes things come to you in a moment of inspiration, and in that moment, you can see the Matrix.*
- Refactored most of the core framework classes.
- Abstracted more internal classes by nesting them inside the core client class.

## July 21st, 2019 - 0.4 build 248 - The Wizard of Oz
*Just like Dorothy, we've set off on the yellow brick road. This it the initial release which provides the core framework over which the rest will be built. Built on top of the amazing RestSharp and Newtonsoft libraries, this custom REST client aims to simplify interacting with the Freshdesk API in a strongly typed .NET world.*
- Initial release.
